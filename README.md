# Hello.

hi, i'm 1237 (pronounced "twelve three seven" (or "dua belas tiga tujuh", in indonesian)), a multi-genre music producer & mindustry modder from Indonesia.

## Random Facts

- i like making, ~~buying~~, and releasing albums.
- even though i'm a music producer, i've never made a music-related program.
- i like playing (and modding) mindustry. I have captured 160 sectors in the campaign.
- most of my art/sprites/music are weird and very experimental.
- binary0011 isn't my first mindustry mod, and even that mod has a hjson version.
